# Etsy Listing Data Analysis

I'm going to do analysis on which tags do best in getting viewership.

## Starting off

0. Prerequisites
   a. You should already have etsy-keystring and callback-url in your .env file
   b. You can get etsy-keystring from the etsy api page and callback-url from pipedreams.com

1. Get the authentication code
   a. Run get_authcode.py
   b. Click the link and log in to send a get request
   c. Check pipedreams.com to get your code. Copy & paste value into etsy-code in .env file

2. After that, run whatever file you need to.
